----------------------

To compile

   First compile the codaclass lib.
      
     cd codaclass ;  make libcoda.a ;  cp libcoda.a ../src/

  Then in ./src compile the main code.

     cd src ; make 

  The executible "pan" gets moved by the makefile to the
  main directory "/pan" where you are reading this.
 
     You need a "db" file (example: control.db) which ideally would be
   generated automatically for each run by the DAQ and then read in
   by the code.  If this scheme is not set up yet, one may specify
   a local "db" file with the "-D" option

        ./pan -f $file -D control.db -D maxevents 5999 -D lobeam -1000

   Here, $file is the data file, e.g. /adaq2/data1/apar/parity18_3789.dat

   Any line in control.db can be overwritten by subsequent "-D" inputs.

	Example: the "lobeam" cut may be +1000 control.db, but if there's
            no beam it will cut all events.  Using "-D lobeam -2000"
            over-rides that.

   For convenience, we may use a script that does the above command,
   see "runpan"

            ./runpan 3789
